Here is the submission of your requirement, I ensure this script runs smoothly in standard development environment with minimal setup.
Used various selenium interfaces, methods along with java to achieve this task(JavaScript Executor, Actions, WebDriver..etc)
I have used the dragAndDropBy for the slider to move but it couldn't possible to move exactly to 820 using slider because of the slider width which is 7pixels, but our requirement is to get 820 which is will not be divided by 7. So, I have set it to 823.
By using text box option, I have set it to 560 and selected the required checkboxes by using scolldown methods.
I have again updated the text box to 820 to calculate the Total gross revenue as per your requirement and validates the header displaying Total Recurring Reimbursement for all Patients Per Month: shows the value $110700.
It is successfully validated and completed as per your requiremnt.
I have successfuly push the code to Github repo and provided the link in submission form.
